# streamlined_qbold_tools
Scripts used to produce quantitative maps of baseline brain oxygenation from FLAIR-GASE data. See streamlined-qBOLD paper for more info.

# NOTES:
# run.qbold_make is just a wrapper to run the example
# Add x.zaverage and x.qbold_make to shell path
# Add MatLab path (line 48) so you can run from command line
# add the ase_qbold_3d function to matlab path in setup.m
# Possible changes ...
# - give option for output directory name in x.qbold_make
# - don't bother with the number counter when looping over voxels in ase_qbold_3d
# - upload example image?
